# `Field`

The `Field` component is how you connect each individual input to the Redux store. There are 
three fundamental things that you need to understand in order to use `Field` correctly:

1. The `name` prop is required. It is a string path, in dot-and-bracket notation, corresponding to 
a value in the form values. It may be as simple as `'firstName'` or as complicated as
`contact.billing.address[2].phones[1].areaCode`.

2. The `component` prop is required. It may be a `Component`, a stateless
function, or string name of one of the default supported DOM inputs (`input`, `textarea` or 
`select`), See [Usage](#usage) section below. To learn about the props that will provided to
whatever your `component` is, see the [Props](#props) section below.

3. All other props will be passed along to the element generated by the `component` prop.

## Importing

```javascript
var Field = require('redux-form').Field;  // ES5
```
```javascript
import { Field } from 'redux-form';  // ES6
```

## Props you can pass to `Field`

#### `name : String` [required]

A string path, in dot-and-bracket notation, corresponding to a value in the form values. It may 
be as simple as `'firstName'` or as complicated as
`contact.billing.address[2].phones[1].areaCode`. See the [Usage](#usage) section below for details.

#### `component : Component|Function|String` [required]

A `Component`, stateless function, or string corresponding to a default JSX element.
See the [Usage](#usage) section below for details.

#### `defaultValue: any` [optional]

A value to be used if the current value for this field is `undefined` in the Redux Store. 
Defaults to `''` to ensure that the input is
[controlled](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/forms.html#controlled-components).

## Usage

The `component` prop will be passed to
[`React.createElement()`](http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/top-level-api.html#react.createelement),
which accepts one of three possible things:

### 1. A component

This can be any component class that you have written or have imported from a third party library.

```js
// MyCustomInput.js
import React, { Component } from 'react'

class MyCustomInput extends Component {
  render() {
    const { value, onChange } = this.props
    return (
      <div>
        <span>The current value is {value}.</span>
        <button type="button" onClick={() => onChange(value + 1)}>Inc</button>
        <button type="button" onClick={() => onChange(value - 1)}>Dec</button>
      </div>
    )
  }
}
```

Then, somewhere in your form...

```js
import MyCustomInput from './MyCustomInput'

...

<Field component={MyCustomInput}/>
```

To learn what props will be passed to your component, see the [Props](#props) section below.

### 2. A stateless function

This is the most flexible way to use `<Field>`, as it gives you complete control over how the 
input is rendered. It is especially useful for displaying validation errors. It will also be the 
most familiar to people migrating from previous versions of `redux-form`.

```js
<Field component={(props) => {
  return (
    <div class="input-row">
      <input type="text" {...props}/>
      {props.touched && props.error && <span className="error">{props.error}</span>}
    </div>
  )
}}/>
```

To learn what props will be passed to your stateless function, see the [Props](#props) section 
below.


### 3. A string: `input`, `select`, or `textarea`

So all you really need to render an `redux-form`-connected text input is:

```js
<Field component="input" type="text"/>
```
Remember the second rule above that all other props are passed to the element generated by 
`component`? So the `type="text"` prop will be given to the input.


## Props

#### `active : boolean`

> `true` if this field currently has focus. It will only work if you are passing `onFocus` to your
input element.

#### `asyncValidating : boolean`

> `true` if the form is currently running asynchronous validation because this field was blurred.

#### `checked : boolean` [optional]

> An alias for `value` _only when `value` is a boolean_. Provided for convenience of destructuring
the whole field
object into the props of a form element.

#### `dirty : boolean`

> `true` if the field value has changed from its initialized value. Opposite of `pristine`.

#### `error : String` [optional]

> The error for this field if its value is not passing validation. Both synchronous,
asynchronous, and submit validation errors will be reported here.

#### `invalid : boolean`

> `true` if the field value fails validation (has a validation error). Opposite of `valid`.

#### `name : String`

> The name prop passed in.

#### `onBlur(eventOrValue) : Function`

> A function to call when the form field loses focus. It expects to _either_ receive the 
[React SyntheticEvent](http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/events.html) _or_ the current
value of the field.

#### `onChange(eventOrValue) : Function`

> A function to call when the form field is changed. It expects to _either_ receive the 
[React SyntheticEvent](http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/events.html) _or_ the new value
of the field.

#### `onDragStart(event) : Function`

> A function to call when the form field receives a `dragStart` event. Saves the field value
in the event for giving the field it is dropped into.

#### `onDrop(event) : Function`

> A function to call when the form field receives a `drop` event.

#### `onFocus(event) : Function`

> A function to call when the form field receives focus.

#### `onUpdate(eventOrValue) : Function`

> An alias for `onChange`. Provided for convenience of destructuring the whole field object into
the props of a form element. Added to provide out-of-the-box support for
[Belle](http://nikgraf.github.io/belle/) components'
[`onUpdate` API](https://github.com/nikgraf/belle/issues/58).

#### `pristine : boolean`

> `true` if the field value is the same as its initialized value. Opposite of `dirty`.

#### `touched : boolean`

> `true` if the field has been touched. By default this will be set when the field is blurred.

#### `valid : boolean`

> `true` if the field value passes validation (has no validation errors). Opposite of `invalid`.

#### `value: any`

> The value of this form field. It will be a boolean for checkboxes, and a string for all other
input types. If there is no value in the Redux state for this field, it will default to the
`defaultValue` prop given to `Field`. If no such `defaultValue` is specified, it will be `''`.
This is to ensure that the input is
[controlled](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/forms.html#controlled-components).

#### `visited: boolean`

> `true` if this field has ever had focus. It will only work if you are passing `onFocus` to 
your input element.
